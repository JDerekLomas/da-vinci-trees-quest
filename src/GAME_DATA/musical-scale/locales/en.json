      "S3_D3_F14_C2": "Well, it's all about understanding the science behind sound! You see, sound is made up of vibrations, and to create music, we need to manipulate those vibrations.",
      "S3_D4_F15_C1": "So, what's the first step in making those vibrations work for music?",
      "S3_D5_F16_C2": "Great question! The first thing to understand is that different pitches, or notes, are just vibrations happening at different speeds. The speed of these vibrations is called <strong>frequency</strong>, and it's measured in <strong>hertz (Hz)</strong>, that's how many vibrations happen per second.",
      "S3_D6_F17_C1": "So, faster vibrations mean a higher pitch, and slower vibrations mean a lower pitch, right?",
      "S3_D7_F18_C2": "That's correct! When you play two notes together, the ratio between their frequencies determines how they sound when combined. If the ratio is simple, like <strong>2:1</strong>, the notes will sound harmonious together.",
      "S3_D8_F19_C1": "So, if the frequency of one note is twice as fast as another, they sound good together?",
      "S3_D9_F20_C2": "Yes! That's an example of an octave. So, if you play a note and then play it one octave higher, it sounds similar, but with a higher pitch.",

      "S4_D3_F24_C2": "Yes! When the ratio is simple, like <strong>2:1</strong> or <strong>3:2</strong>, the notes sound smooth and harmonious. But with more uneven ratios, like <strong>15:8</strong>, the sound has more tension — we call that a more complex or dissonant sound.",
