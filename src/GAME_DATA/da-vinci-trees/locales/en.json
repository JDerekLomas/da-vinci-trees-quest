      "d32": "Think of a tree as a plumbing system. Water flows from roots to leaves. If the pipes suddenly got narrower, there'd be a bottleneck.",
      "d33": "The total pipe capacity stays constant. That's why da Vinci's rule works. It reflects how trees actually move water.",
      "d34": "Okay, that makes sense. But how does that help me measure volume?",

      "d38": "The branches are folding in... they're all pointing straight up now...",
      "d39": "Oh! It's a cylinder. When the branches fold up completely, the whole tree becomes a cylinder!",
      "d40": "Exactly. Because Da Vinci's rule conserves cross-sectional area, the tree was a cylinder all along, just spread out. So to find a tree's volume, we can use the formula for a cylinder.",
      "d41": "The volume of a cylinder is <strong>V = \u03c0r\u00b2h</strong>, where r is the radius of the trunk and h is the height. For our oak with a 70 cm diameter and 22 meter height, that's all we need to estimate volume.",
      "d42": "Now try the other controls. The <strong>Depth</strong> slider controls how many times the branches split. More depth means a more complex tree.",
      "d43": "And <strong>Length Ratio</strong> determines how much shorter each new branch is compared to its parent. Real trees are usually around 0.7 to 0.8.",
      "d44": "The most important one is <strong>Leonardo \u03b1</strong>. When a branch splits into two, the equation is: <strong>D\u1d45 = d\u2081\u1d45 + d\u2082\u1d45</strong>. The parent diameter D raised to the power \u03b1 equals the sum of the child diameters raised to \u03b1.",

      "d45_interactive": "Try changing Leonardo \u03b1 away from 2. See how the tree looks unnatural? The branches become too thick or too thin. Da Vinci's value of 2 is what real trees use."

      "d45": "The diameter tape says 70 centimeters. That's measured at breast height, about 1.4 meters up, right?",
      "d46": "Right. We call that <strong>DBH</strong>, or Diameter at Breast Height. It's the standard measurement foresters use worldwide.",
      "d47": "Now for height. Let me pace back and use the inclinometer...",
      "d48": "Angle to the top is 47 degrees. I'm standing about 25 meters back... <em>[checks calculation on tablet]</em> That works out to about 22 meters total height.",
      "d50": "Good. Now we convert volume to carbon. Oak has a wood density of about 600 kilograms per cubic meter.",
      "d51": "Let me plug that into the calculator... that's about <strong>5,100 kg</strong> of wood.",

      "d55": "Good eye. These are <strong>conifers</strong>, or cone-bearing trees. They evolved for different conditions than deciduous trees.",
      "d56": "Snow load, for one. A wide-spreading oak shape would collect snow and break. The conical shape sheds it.",
      "d57": "So the cylinder model won't work for these?",
      "d58": "Not quite. Look at the shape: widest at the base, tapering to a point at the top. What geometric solid does that remind you of?",
      "d59": "A cone!",
      "d60": "Exactly. For conifers, we model the tree as a cone instead of a cylinder. The volume of a cone is one-third the volume of a cylinder with the same base and height.<div style='display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 20px 0;'><img src='./assets/images/cone-volume-proof.png' alt='Visual proof that cone volume is one-third of cylinder volume' style='width: 100%; max-width: 350px; border-radius: 8px; background: white; padding: 10px;'></div>",

      "interactive_title": "Volume Comparison",
      "d64": "These models seem too simple. How do we know they're accurate?",
      "d65": "Good instinct. Let's test our models against reality. I have data from research studies where trees were actually cut down and measured piece by piece.",
      "d66": "Remember our oak tree? You calculated 8.5 cubic meters using the cylinder model. Researchers measured a similar oak by cutting it into 1-meter sections and calculating each section's volume using water displacement.",
      "d67": "The actual measured volume was 5.1 cubic meters. My cylinder model predicted 8.5 m³. That's way off! The cylinder model overestimated by a lot.",
      "d68": "Now check your Douglas fir cone prediction against the measured value.",
      "d69": "Actual measured volume: 2.4 cubic meters. I underestimated this time. Closer than the cylinder, but still not quite right.",
      "d70": "So the cylinder overestimates, and the cone underestimates. Real trees are somewhere in between?",
      "d71": "Exactly. Real trees are closer to a shape called a <em>paraboloid</em>, something in between. Foresters use a correction called a '<strong>form factor</strong>.' Let me show you.",
      "d72": "The form factor is the ratio of actual volume to cylinder volume. Most trees have form factors between <strong>0.4 and 0.6</strong>.",
      "d74": "So our refined formula becomes: <strong>V = f \u00d7 \u03c0r\u00b2h</strong>, where f is the form factor (typically 0.45-0.55).",
      "d76": "So the model isn't perfect, but it's useful. Good enough to solve real problems.",

      "d80": "How big are the plots?",
      "d81": "Usually 1/10 of an acre, about 11 meters in radius. We walk through each plot and measure every tree inside it.",
      "d82_new": "And we just scale up the results?",
      "d83_new": "Exactly. If our sample plots cover 1% of the forest, and we find 500 tons of carbon in those plots, we estimate the whole forest has about 50,000 tons.",
